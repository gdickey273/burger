  ## Usage
  
  Upon navigating to the page, any burger information stored in the database will be rendered. Each burger with "devoured:false" will be listed on the left by name along with their id number and a "Devour It" button. Burgers with "devoured:true" will be listed on the right by name with their id as well. The user can click a burger's "Devour It" button to update that burgers "devoured" status and move it to the right side of the screen. Below the user can use the Add a Burger form to add a new burger into the database.
